cdi-sessionscoped-login
=======================

Usage of a @SessionScoped login with TomEE and JPA.

I didn't found a working example with plain CDI-Beans, maybe i am totally wrong too,
but i think for the community and JavaEE/CDI-starters LIKE ME(!!!) its a helpful source.

Thanks to the internet and a lot of stuff i read in the last weeks.

Hint: i used TomEE 1.5.2-SNAPSHOT, just to have the latest "bugfixed" version.
